1. install the following package
    npm i redux
    npm i react-redux
2. create a reducer
    1. create a initial state which is an object
    2. Reducer is an arrow fuction with two arguemnts ( state, action)
    3. initialize state with initial state
    4. simply return state within the function
3. Come to app wrap whole component with provider
    1. import createStore from redux
        import {createStore} from 'redux'
    2. import reducer
        import reducer from './redux/reducer';
    3. create a store
        const store = createStore(reducer)
    4. import Provider from 'react-redux'
        import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
    5. wrap whole app with provider by passing store as props
4. connect your component (UI) with store
    1. import connect from 'react-redux'
        import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { type } from '@testing-library/user-event/dist/type'
    2. use mapStateToProps function with state as an argument and return necessary values
                const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
                    return {
                      count: state.count
                       }
                    }
    3. call the state value with props
    4. connect your component with mapStateToProps

5. component to  update any value in the state
1. Dispatch an action
2. action is a function it returns object { type, payload }
3. action will trigger reducer
4. reducer will change the value.
